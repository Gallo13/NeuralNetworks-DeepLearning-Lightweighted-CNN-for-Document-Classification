Answers to these questions are in repository.

Pick-up your project from the papers and links listed in the Project 2 site. All of them are papers with a code. Pick-up a paper that is published after 2014.

a) Problem Description: What is the problem that you will be investigating? Provide paper titles, authors and other detail and upload the paper on the BB.

b) Data: What data will you use? Usually in the papers they present experiments using more than one dataset. Pick-up one that you will be using for your experiments. It could be a particular dataset from a chosen paper or one that you propose. Upload it on the BB and provide details.

c) Methodology/Algorithm: In the papers very often they propose more than one approach. Pick-up the one that you like and provide details of it.

d) Your Approach: This section details the framework of your project. Be specific.

e) Experiment(s): You use the respective code that was proposed in the chosen paper. Then show in details the results of your experiments. By details, I mean both quantitative evaluations (show numbers, figures, tables, etc.) as well as qualitative results (show images, example results, etc.).

f) Report: How do you evaluate your results? Analyze and compare your results with those proposed in the respective paper (for this report only not less than 1 - 2 full page(s), Times New Roman 11, single space).
