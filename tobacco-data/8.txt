Research experience:
I have 46 primary publications dating back to 1959. One of my earliest studies

was a comparison of dCMP deaminase activity in normal and malignant mammalian
tissue (Cancer Res. g;, 454, 1963). Many of my earlier publications involved
kinetic studies of various enzymes derived from normal and malignant tissue.
In 1967, I (with Drs. E. Derek and P.R. Srinivasan) provided the first
demonstration of mammalian DNA methylase (Biochem. Z, 280). In 1967, I joined
Dr. Alex Novikoff in the Department of Pathology at the Albert Einstein College
learning electron microscopic techniques. In 1969, I joined the SUNY Health
to include experimental cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In addition to
my research, I have for the past 21 years been teaching cancer chemotherapy and
immunotherapy to medical students, house staff and practicing physicians
(Continuing Education) at the Medical Center and affiliated hospitals.
